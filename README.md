# SoftwareDesignDocument

The client Gaming Room is moving their popular game to a mobile platform.  They requested a design document detailing specific suggestions for how they should go about doing so.  With my current experience in iOS application development I gave my best advice in moving to an iOS application that could be scaled with more users utilizing cloud storage.  
Utilizing a design document can be very helpful for a developer knowing exactly what the objectives are requested by the client.  I would give more detail in my reasoning for my selection of using iOS as the primary platform for the app as well as give more detail on which cloud storage platform I would use being Google Firebase.  In any stage of the deployment of an application, you should have the end user in mind at all times.  It is important to tailor your app to the client's needs, but knowing the end userbase and how they plan to utilize the application is extremely important in giving design suggestions.
For a larger project drawing out a UML Design can be crucial to figure out relations in the development of an application.  Also just a ton of research.  I am partial to iOS having developed a few apps previously, but knowing more about Android or other operating systems can be crucial to deciding whether or not to utilize those systems.
